STEP 2 - DATA PROCESSOR (MERGER AND FILTER)
====================================

This script will extract specific fields from step1.json and merge them by match ID.
To be built incrementally in Jupyter.

MERGING LOGIC:
--------------
ID-Based Connections:
1. BY MATCH ID:
   - Live endpoint → gives you match.id
   - Details endpoint → query with match.id → returns detailed match info (environment, venue, etc.)
   - Odds endpoint → query with match.id → returns betting odds

2. BY TEAM ID:
   - Live/Details endpoints → give you home_team_id and away_team_id
   - Team endpoint → query with team_id → returns team names, logos, market values

3. BY COMPETITION ID:
   - Live/Details endpoints → give you competition_id
   - Competition endpoint → query with competition_id → returns competition name, type, logo

4. BY COUNTRY ID:
   - Team endpoint → gives you country_id (which country the team is from)
   - Competition endpoint → gives you country_id (which country hosts the competition)
   - Country endpoint → returns all countries (you filter by country_id)

The Complete Flow:
1. Get live matches (each has match_id, home_team_id, away_team_id, competition_id)
2. Use match_id → fetch details & odds
3. Collect all unique team_ids → fetch team info
4. Collect all unique competition_ids → fetch competition info  
5. Fetch country list once (for reference)

This mapping allows Step 2 to merge everything together - taking a match and enriching it with 
team names, competition details, country info, weather data, and betting odds all connected by their respective IDs.

FIELDS TO EXTRACT FROM STEP 1:
------------------------------
ENDPOINT 1: /match/detail_live (live)
- id (match id)

ENDPOINT 2: /match/recent/list (details)
- id (match id)
- season_id
- competition_id
- home_team_id
- away_team_id
- status_id
- home_scores[]
- away_scores[]
- home_position
- away_position
- environment{} (weather data - OPTIONAL:
  - weather_id
  - pressure
  - temperature
  - wind_speed
  - humidity
  - weather)

ENDPOINT 3: /odds/history (odds)
Results keyed by Company ID (2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 22):
- asia[] (8 elements per array)
- bs[] (8 elements per array)
- eu[] (8 elements per array)
- cr[] (8 elements per array)
Each array contains: [timestamp, match_time, odds_values..., status, sealed, score]

ENDPOINT 4: /team/additional/list (team)
- id (team id)
- competition_id
- country_id
- name
- uid (merged team id)

ENDPOINT 5: /competition/additional/list (competition)
- id (competition id)
- category_id
- country_id
- name

ENDPOINT 6: /country/list (country)
- id (country id)
- category_id
- name
