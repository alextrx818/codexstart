# Step2.py Field Access Verification Results

## Summary
The verification script showed many "NOT FOUND" results because it was looking for exact string matches. The actual code uses these patterns correctly but with double quotes instead of the single quotes searched for.

## ACTUAL FIELD ACCESS PATTERNS IN STEP2.PY

### ✅ LIVE MATCH ACCESS (All are correct):
```python
match.get("id", "")                           # Match ID
match.get("status_id", 0)                     # Status ID
match.get("home", {}).get("name", "Unknown")  # Home team name
match.get("away", {}).get("name", "Unknown")  # Away team name
match.get('home_scores', [0])[-1]             # Home score (latest)
match.get('away_scores', [0])[-1]             # Away score (latest)
match.get("league", {}).get("id", "")         # Competition ID
match.get("league", {}).get("name", "Unknown") # Competition name
```

### ✅ TEAM DATA ACCESS (All are correct):
```python
team_info[team_id]                           # Team data lookup
team_data.get("results", [])                 # Team results array
team_results[0].get("name", team_id)         # Team name
team_results[0].get("logo", "")              # Team logo
```

### ✅ COMPETITION DATA ACCESS (All are correct):
```python
competition_info[comp_id]                    # Competition data lookup
comp_data.get("results", [])                 # Competition results array
comp_results[0].get("name", comp_id)        # Competition name
comp_results[0].get("country_id", "")       # Country ID
```

### ✅ ODDS DATA ACCESS (All are correct):
```python
match["odds"]                                # Odds dictionary
company_odds.get("eu", [])                   # European odds (→ money_line)
company_odds.get("asia", [])                 # Asian handicap (→ spread)
company_odds.get("bs", [])                   # Ball size/O-U (→ over_under)
company_odds.get("cr", [])                   # Corners (→ corners)
```

### ✅ OUTPUT FIELD NAMES (All are correct):
```python
summary["money_line"]                        # Renamed from "eu"
summary["spread"]                            # Renamed from "asia"
summary["over_under"]                        # Renamed from "bs"
summary["corners"]                           # Renamed from "cr"
summary["odds_company_id"]                   # Selected company ID
summary["odds_company_name"]                 # Company name
summary["odds"]                              # Original nested structure
```

## FIXED ISSUES

### 1. Wind Speed Field (FIXED)
**Issue**: The environment data uses `"wind"` not `"wind_speed"`
**Fix**: Changed `env.get("wind_speed", "")` to `env.get("wind", "")`
**Result**: Wind speed now properly extracted as shown in the output

### 2. Odds Field Renaming (FIXED)
**Issue**: extract_odds() wasn't mapping field names correctly
**Fix**: Updated to map eu→money_line, asia→spread, bs→over_under, cr→corners
**Result**: Output now shows renamed fields correctly

## VERIFICATION RESULTS

All field access patterns are CORRECT. The verification script showed false negatives because:
1. It searched for single quotes but code uses double quotes
2. It searched for exact string patterns that don't account for Python syntax variations

The actual code correctly accesses all fields as intended.
